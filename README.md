=======

The re-write of the ZWBapp. 

What's on the cards?

UI:
- Update to cover some aspects of Material Design

Web Scraper:
- Scrape the one URL, instead of all sub-URLs for rules 
- Scrape the headings and create a menu structure from them
- Display the rules as HTML, not just extracting the text
- Have links to other rules work through intents
- Ability to update/ refresh the rules whenever the user likes

RSS Feed:
- Save articles in the DB
- Check for new articles, rather than retrieve all of them (date updated field? Not sure, yet)
- Notify users of new articles

Hand Signals
- Use Bruce's images
- Link to hand signals from rules (possibly a tab?)
